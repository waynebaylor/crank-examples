# Crank Examples

[Crank.js](https://crank.js.org/) is a relatively new javascript library and there aren't a lot of code examples to look at for information/ideas yet. This collection of examples is intended to expand that body of work and show how you can use Crank to develop apps.

## TodoMVC

This is an implementation of the TodoMVC specification. The goal for this example is to treat TodoMVC as an app and to take a structured approach to implementing it.

See [todomvc/README.md](./todomvc/README.md) for details.

## Simple Infinite Scroll

Implementing infinite scroll with Crank.

See [simple-infinite-scroll/README.md](./simple-infinite-scroll/README.md) for details.

## Advanced Infinite Scroll

This example takes _Simple Infinite Scroll_ and makes some optimizations.

See [advanced-infinite-scroll/README.md](./advanced-infinite-scroll/README.md) for details.
